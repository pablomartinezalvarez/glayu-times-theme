# Glayu Times Theme

![mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmartinezalvarez/glayu-times/master/mock.png)

This is the [Glayu](https://github.com/pmartinezalvarez/glayu) static site generator default theme. It is inspired by old style newspapers. The project is derived from the [Glayu Times](https://github.com/pmartinezalvarez/glayu-times) bootstrap template, and all the included assets are compiled. If you want to update the theme appearance please work on the bootstrap version.  

## Quick Start

To enable this theme on your Glayu site ensure that your `_config.yml` includes:
 
 ```yml
 theme: glayu-times
 theme_uri: https://github.com/pmartinezalvarez/glayu-times-theme/archive/master.zip
 ```
 
 And run:
 ```console
$ glayu init
```
 
 By default this theme is included on your Glayu site the first time you run the `glayu init` command.
